#Cisco NAT Configuration


##Designating Inside and Outside interfaces
The first step to configuring NAT on any Cisco IOS router is designating which interfaces should be considered *“Inside”* and which should be considered *“Outside”*.

On Cisco Routers, the designation uses the commands *^ip nat outside^* and *^ip nat inside^*:

(((gray
interface fa0/0
 * ip nat outside*

interface fa0/1
 * ip nat inside*

interface fa0/2
 * ip nat inside*
)))gray

#Static NAT

A Static NAT is a translation in which *only the IP addresses are being modified*, and the mapping between pre-translation and post-translation IP addresses is explicitly defined.

To configure Static NAT on a Cisco IOS router to match the translation depicted above, first *designate the Inside and Outside interfaces*, then apply the following command:
(((gray
*ip nat  inside source  static  10.2.2.33  73.8.2.33*
)))gray

*-* *Syntax:*

(((gray
*ip nat  inside source  static  ^<Inside Local IP>^  ^<Inside Global IP>^*
)))gray

#Static PAT

A Static PAT is a translation in which *the IP Addresses and Port numbers are being modified*, and the mapping between pre-translation and post-translation attributes is explicitly defined

To configure Static PAT on a Cisco router to match the translation depicted above, *first designate the Inside and Outside interfaces*, then apply the following commands:

(((gray
*ip nat  inside source  static  tcp  ^10.4.4.41^ 8080  ^73.8.2.44^ 80  extendable*
*ip nat  inside source  static  tcp  ^10.4.4.42^ 443  ^73.8.2.44^ 443  extendable*
)))gray

*-* *Syntax:*

(((gray
*ip nat  inside source  static^ <protocol> <Inside Local IP:Port> <Inside Global IP:Port> ^ extendable*
)))gray

*inside source	:* Translate the Source IP of packets arriving on interfaces labeled with ip nat inside.
*<protocol>:*	Designates which protocol is being translated, typically this will be TCP or UDP.
*extendable :*	Allow a single global address to be mapped to multiple local address.
