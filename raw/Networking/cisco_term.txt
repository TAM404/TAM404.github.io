#Cisco NAT terminology
If you’ve made it here, then at this point you should have a solid understanding of each of the four types of translation that can exist: *Static NAT, Static PAT, Dynamic PAT, and Dynamic NAT*. Moreover, you have an understanding of *Policy NAT *and* Twice NAT,* which are simply two different ways of implementing the four types of NAT.

*^Cisco^* has created some NAT terminology which explicitly refer to the IP addresses and/or ports involved in Network Address Translation (NAT).
*Cisco has designated some NAT terminology which explicitly reference a set of addresses with absolute certainty and ^no ambiguity^, that apply to all traffic directions.*

^*+*^ *Inside Local* – a host that physically exists on the Inside network, as seen from the perspective of the Inside network
^*+*^ *Inside Global* – a host that physically exists on the Inside network, as seen from the perspective of the Outside network
^*+*^ *Outside Local* – a host that physically exists on the Outside network, as seen from the perspective of the Inside network
^*+*^ *Outside Global* – a host that physically exists on the Outside network, as seen from the perspective of the Outside network

*Inside* vs *Outside* refer to the physical location of the real owner of the address in question
*Local* vs *Global* refer to perspective you are viewing the address from, in relationship to the NAT device

The attributes *10.1.1.11:3333* refers to a host on ^*the Inside network*^, and is what that host appears as when viewed from the *^Local perspective^*.
 Hence, this is the ^* Inside Local address*^.
